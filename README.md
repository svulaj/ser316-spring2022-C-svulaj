# SER316 BearWorkshop Simulator
This simulates a bear workshop for kids and has a few requirements.

Specifically, Bears are composed of different components like "shells" or the 
outer skin, all bears have stuffing. A bear's outer shell is made of some kind of 
material and contributes to the cost of the bear. Premium materials can cost extra.
Likewise, the customer can select either the default kind of stuffing (pollyfill)
or a premium stuffing for an additional cost.

Bears can optionally be built with noise makers. Noisemakers might be things like 
a button on their hand that says "I wuv you" when you press it. Alternatively, 
a noisemakers might be custom and include recorded sound - up to x number of 
seconds - that plays when you press their chest. If noisemakers go in different 
locations, bears can have multiple noise makers.

Bears can also have initials or sayings embroidered on them as a kind of bear 
tattoo. These might be the kid owners name, a saying, or whatever the customer 
wants.

Finally, customers can get clothing accessories for the bear. These are of course 
expensive add-ons.

All children must be 13 years of age in order to buy a bear. Alternatively, they 
can have parental consent - that parent must be 18 years of age or older.
